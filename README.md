Welcome to the **Java Tutorial** repository!

#Simple tip
-- If you are getting a string as an input after a integer then you must add blank input so that it can't stop the program right there.

#Stack
--Stores the primitive data types for quick access

#Heap
--Stores the Object data Types like string in string pool

#ternary vs ifElse:
--ternary returns the value and ifElse can't return a value.
